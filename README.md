# CGx's pi-emote

> **Currently looking to expand the emotes gallery!** If you have an emote set you'd like to submit, please make a PR!

Animated pixel-art emote that lives in the top-right corner of your pi TUI session. Reacts to what the agent is doing — thinking, talking, reading, writing, using tools, etc.

![pi-emote demo](pi-emote-demo.gif)

Supports Kitty, iTerm2, and ASCII rendering.

## Config

Drop a `config.json` in one of these paths (highest priority wins):

- `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-emote/config.json` — your global prefs
- `.pi/extensions/pi-emote/config.json` — project override

Only include what you want to change:

```json
{
  "size": 12,
  "emotes": [
    { "model": "*claude*", "emote-set": "my-avatar" }
  ]
}
```

See `config.json` in the extension root for all defaults.

### Theme

Customize the widget colors. All fields are optional — omitted fields use the defaults below:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "model-name": "accent",
    "progress-bar": {
      "default": "text",
      "cache-hit": "success",
      "cache-miss": "error",
      "almost-full": "warning"
    },
    "token-info": "dim",
    "working-directory": "warning",
    "border": "thinking-level-color",
    "vertical-separator": "thinking-level-color"
  }
}
```

- **`model-name`** — model, thinking level, and context window (always bold)
- **`progress-bar`** — token usage and context fill; color follows the context state:
  - `cache-miss`: cache hit rate between 0% and 50% → `error`
  - `almost-full`: context fill ≥ 75% → `warning` (when not a cache-miss)
  - `cache-hit`: cache hit rate ≥ 50% → `success` (when not almost-full)
  - `default`: no cache data yet (0% hit rate on a fresh session) → `text`
- **`token-info`** — input/output tokens, cache hit rate, cost
- **`working-directory`** — current working directory
- **`border`** — top border line
- **`vertical-separator`** — the `│` divider beside the avatar

Each value is either a pi theme color token or the special `thinking-level-color` flag. `thinking-level-color` follows the thinking level's color (the same color the border uses by default), so it shifts live when the thinking level changes — unlike a fixed token like `thinkingHigh`, which pins one specific level's color.

Available theme color tokens: `accent`, `border`, `borderAccent`, `borderMuted`, `success`, `error`, `warning`, `muted`, `dim`, `text`, `thinkingText`, `thinkingOff`–`thinkingMax`, `md*`, `syntax*`, `tool*` (full list in `src/types.ts`). All colors update live when pi's theme changes — no restart needed.

Invalid values are ignored with a warning and fall back to the defaults.

## Multiplexers

pi-emote can render image avatars through **tmux** using DCS passthrough. When tmux is detected, pi-emote auto-detects the outer terminal and picks the right image protocol.

### tmux Setup

Add these to your `tmux.conf`:

```bash
# Required — allow image sequences to pass through to the outer terminal
set -g allow-passthrough on

# Required — detect outer terminal when attaching from a different terminal
set -ga update-environment TERM
set -ga update-environment TERM_PROGRAM

# Recommended — reduces flicker during animation
set -sg escape-time 0
```

Then restart tmux completely:

```bash
tmux kill-server && tmux
```

Without `allow-passthrough`, pi-emote defaults to ASCII and shows a one-time warning with setup instructions.

### Experimental Multiplexer Support

| Outer Terminal | Protocol | Status |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| Ghostty | kitty-unicode | ✅ Stable, pane-safe, auto-detected |
| kitty | kitty-unicode | ⚠️ Untested, pane-safe, auto-detected |
| WarpTerminal | kitty-unicode | ⚠️ Untested, pane-safe, auto-detected |
| iTerm2 | iterm2 | ⚠️ Experimental, opt-in only (pane bleed in multi-pane layouts) |
| WezTerm | iterm2 | ⚠️ Experimental, opt-in only (not verified) |

The outer terminal is detected via `tmux show-environment TERM_PROGRAM`, which reflects the currently attached terminal.

Ghostty and kitty use the **kitty-unicode** renderer (Unicode placeholders) which is pane-safe — images stay within their pane and clean up on session switch. This is the default when auto-detected.

iTerm2 and WezTerm use DCS passthrough for the iTerm2 image protocol. This works but has known limitations: images can bleed into adjacent panes and persist when switching sessions. **Not enabled by default** — opt in explicitly:

```json
{
  "terminals": [
    { "match": "tmux", "render": "iterm2" }
  ]
}
```

### Other Multiplexers

**zellij** and **screen** are not yet supported and default to ASCII.

### Manual Override

Force a specific renderer:

```json
{
  "terminals": [
    { "match": "tmux", "render": "kitty-unicode" }
  ]
}
```

Available render values for tmux: `"auto"`, `"kitty-unicode"`, `"kitty"`, `"iterm2"`, `"ascii"`.

- `"auto"` — detect outer terminal; uses kitty-unicode for Ghostty/kitty, ASCII for others
- `"kitty-unicode"` — pane-safe Unicode placeholders (Ghostty, kitty)
- `"kitty"` — classic DCS passthrough (single-pane only, experimental)
- `"iterm2"` — iTerm2 DCS passthrough (single-pane only, experimental)
- `"ascii"` — text fallback

## Custom Emotes

Emote sets live in `emotes/<set-name>/` with PNG frames per state:

```
emotes/my-avatar/
├── idle/*.png
├── think/*.png
├── talk/*.png
├── read/*.png
├── write/*.png
├── tool/*.png
└── ...          # hi, success, failure, compact
```

Not all states are required. Missing ones just won't animate.

### Where to put them

pi-emote searches in order:

1. `.pi/extensions/pi-emote/emotes/<name>/` (project)
2. `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-emote/emotes/<name>/` (user)
3. Extension built-in → falls back to `default`

### Map models or thinking levels to sets

Glob patterns against model ID and/or thinking level, last match wins:

```json
{
  "emotes": [
    { "model": "*", "emote-set": "default" },
    { "model": "*claude*", "emote-set": "my-avatar" },
    { "model": "*haiku*", "emote-set": "haiku-avatar" }
  ]
}
```

In this example, `claude` models use `my-avatar`, but `haiku` ones use `haiku-avatar`.

Each entry matches on two dimensions — the model ID and the thinking level (`off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`). Unset selectors default to `*`, so existing model-only entries keep working unchanged. An entry matches when **all** of its selectors match; last match wins:

```json
{
  "emotes": [
    { "model": "*claude*", "emote-set": "my-avatar" },
    { "thinking-level": "high", "emote-set": "focused-avatar" }
  ]
}
```

`claude` models get `my-avatar` at any thinking level, while **any** model at high thinking gets `focused-avatar`. To target a specific combination, set both selectors:

```json
{
  "emotes": [
    { "model": "*claude*", "thinking-level": "high", "emote-set": "deep-focus" }
  ]
}
```

This matches only `claude` models thinking at `high` level — anything else falls back to `default`.

Order matters: later entries override earlier ones, so put broad mappings first and refinements last. A warning is logged when two entries clash within the same dimension (two model patterns or two thinking-level patterns both match); a model entry and a thinking-level entry matching together is intentional layering and stays silent.
See `emotes/default/emotes.json` for per-set frame config (blink frames, talk weights).
